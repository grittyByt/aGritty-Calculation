# aGritty-Calculation

Here is a calculator of simple calculation with a message for all who seek to explore their deepest values.  The only way is forward, and with a simple calculator some of the biggest calculations can be simplified.  I hope my calculator design will motivate other coders to keep practicing on their craft so they too are able to make the calculated moves necessary to succeed.

I designed this calculator using just HTML & CSS; although there is inline javascript within the HTML file.  One of the challenges I faced while creating this was designing the calculator to be easy on the eyes.  

The DE (delete) button is set so that if it is clicked upon it will delete only one digit at a time should there be one on the display screen of the calculator.

The AC (all clear) button is set so that it clears the entire screen should there be any digits or operators present on the display screen of the calculator.

The = (equal) button is set so that it evaluates any value in the display screen of the calculator.
